This paper outlines our research into usage tracking of external JavaScript files on the internet. We have used Hadoop to analyse the CommonCrawl dataset to extract some usage metrics of JavaScript libraries. Our results show that JQuery is by far the most popular JavaScript library. The most popular JavaScript file is "show\_ads.js" provided by the Google AdSense program.
