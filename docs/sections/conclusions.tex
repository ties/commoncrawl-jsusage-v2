\section{Conclusions}
Our results give a clear picture of the usage of JavaScript files based on the web pages contained with the Common Crawl dataset, which we assume to be indicative for the whole internet.

Our results do not show a lot of surprises; it mostly confirms what everyone knows and/or thinks, for example that Google Analytics is widely used. However our research and results conclusively proves this and provides a validation for most of the general beliefs about external JavaScript files.

Additionally we have also uncovered a top 10 list of most commonly used external hosts. These hosts are an integral part of the internet due to their high usage. This also makes them a prime target for hackers. This is something to consider when using any of these hosts. Thankfully most of these hosts are run by professional organizations who have the knowledge and technology to properly maintain and secure these hosts. \\
